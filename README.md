# Context:
The real estate markets, like those in Sydney and Melbourne, present an interesting opportunity for data analysts to analyze and predict where property prices are moving towards. Prediction of property prices is becoming increasingly important and beneficial. Property prices are a good indicator of both the overall market condition and the economic health of a country. Considering the data provided, we are wrangling a large set of property sales records stored in an unknown format and with unknown data quality issues.

# Objective: 
The objective of this project, conducted using the Kaggle house price prediction dataset in R, is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model that can effectively predict house prices in the United States. Through the application of data analysis, feature engineering, and advanced regression techniques in R, the project aims to create a predictive model capable of providing reliable estimates of residential property values. This model will serve as a valuable resource for potential homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals, enabling them to make informed decisions and gain insights into the factors influencing house prices in the U.S. housing market. The ultimate goal is to achieve high prediction accuracy and deliver actionable results for the stakeholders involved in real estate transactions.
